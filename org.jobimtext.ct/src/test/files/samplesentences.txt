April is a spring month in the Northern Hemisphere and an autumn fall month in the Southern Hemisphere 
In each hemisphere it is the seasonal equivalent of October in the other 
It is unclear as to where April got its name 
A common theory is that it comes from the Latin word aperire meaning to open referring to flowers opening in spring 
Another theory is that the name could come from Aphrodite the Greek goddess of love

Art is an activity or creation by people that has importance because of an attraction to the human senses 
Art is made when a human expresses himself or herself 
Some art is useful in a practical sense such as a sculptured clay bowl that one can put things in 
Many people disagree on how to define art 
Many people say people are driven to make art due to their inner creativity 
Art includes drawing painting sculpting photography performance art dance music poetry prose and theatre 
Art is divided into the plastic arts where something is made and the performing arts where something is done by humans in action 
The other division is between pure arts done for themselves and practical arts done for a practical purpose but with artistic content 
Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the human mind or spirit 
An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people the amount of people who can relate to it and how much people appreciate it 
The first and broadest sense of art means arrangement or to arrange 
In this sense art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design 
Art can also be a form of expression of emotion 
The artist may feel a certain emotion and feels there is no other way to express it than to create something that means something to them 
Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an audience 
Though if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well then the art work will become publicly successful 
There are sculptures cave painting and rock art dating from the Upper Paleolithic era 
All of the great ancient civilizations such as Ancient Egypt India China Greece Rome or Arabia had works and styles of art 
In the Middle Ages most of the art in Europe showed people from the Bible in paintings stained glass windows and mosaic tile floors and walls 
Islamic art includes geometric patterns Islamic calligraphy and architecture 
In India and Tibet painted sculptures dance and religious painting were done 
In China arts included jade carving bronzework pottery poetry calligraphy music painting drama and fiction 
There are many Chinese artistic styles which are usually named after the ruling dynasty 
In Europe after the Middle Ages there was a Renaissance which means rebirth 
People rediscovered science and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects 
People like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci still painted religious pictures but they also now could paint mythological pictures too 
These artists also invented perspective where things in the distance look smaller than things close up in the picture 
This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other 
In the late 0s artists in Europe responding to Modernity created many new painting styles such as Classicism Romanticism Realism and Impressionism 
The history of twentieth century art includes Expressionism Fauvism Cubism Dadaism Surrealism and Minimalism 
In some societies people think that art belongs to the person who made it such as Indigenous Aboriginal Australian Art They think that the artist put his or her talent into the art 
In this view the art is the property of the artist 
In other societies people think that art belongs to no one 
They think that society has put its social capital into the artist and the artist s work 
In this view society is a collective that has made the art through the artist 
A is the first letter of the English alphabet 
The small letter a is used as a lower case vowel 
However the English long a ā is said as a diphthong of ĕ and y The same letter of the Greek alphabet is named alpha 
Alpha and omega the last letter of the Greek alphabet means the beginning and the end 
In musical notation the letter A is the symbol of a note in the scale below B and above G In binary numbers the letter A is 0 
A is the letter that was used to represent a team in an old TV show The A Team 
The earliest the letter A has appeared was in the Phoenician alphabet s aleph 
This symbol came from a simple picture of an ox head 
This Phoenician letter helped make the basic blocks of later types of the letter 
The Greeks later modified this letter and used it as their letter alpha 
The Greek alphabet was used by the Etruscans in nothern Italy and the Romans later modified the Etruscan alphabet for their own language 
The letter A has six different sounds 
It can sound like æ in the International Phonetic Alphabet such as the word pad 
Other sounds of this letter are in the words father which developed into another sound such as in the word ace 
In algebra the letter A along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities 
In geometry capital A B C etc are used to label line segments lines etc Also A is typically used as one of the letters to label an angle in a triangle 
Air is the Earth s atmosphere 
Air around us is a mixture of many gases and dust particles 
It is the clear gas in which living things live and breathe 
It has an indefinite shape and volume 
It has no color or smell 
It is a matter as it has mass and weight 
There is no air in the vacuum and cosmos 
Air is a mixture of 0 nitrogen 0 oxygen 0 argon 0 carbon dioxide and small amounts of other gases 
There is an average of about 0 water vapour 
Animals need the oxygen in the air to live 
In the human body the lungs give oxygen to the blood and give back carbon dioxide to the air 
Plants need the carbon dioxide in the air to live 
They give off oxygen that humans can breathe again 
Air can be polluted by some gases such as ozone and carbon monoxide smoke and ash 
This pollution is one of the causes of global warming by causing the greenhouse effect 
Aircraft use propellers to move air over a wing which allows them to fly 
Spain is divided in 0 parts called autonomous communities 
Autonomous means that each of these autonomous communities has its own Executive Power its own Legislative Power and its own Judicial Power 
These are similar but NOT the same to states in the United States of America for example 
Spain has fifty smaller parts called provinces 
In 0 these parts came together making the autonomous communities 
Before then some of these provinces were together but were broken 
The groups that were together once before are called historic communities Catalonia Basque Country Galicia and Andalusia 
The Spanish language is the official language in every autonomous commmunity but six which also have other official languages 
List of the autonomous communities with their Capital city the place where the government has its offices 
Spain also has two cities on the north coast of Africa Ceuta and Melilla 
They are called autonomous cities and have simultaneously the majority of the power of an autonomous community and also power of provinces and power of municipalities 
Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS London 0 June 0 Wilmslow Cheshire 0 June 0 was an English mathematician and computer scientist 
He was born in Maida Vale London 
Turing was one of the people who worked on the first computers 
He was the first person to think of using a computer to do things that were too hard for a person to do 
He created the Turing machine in 0 The machine was imaginary but it included the idea of a computer program 
Turing was interested in artificial intelligence 
He proposed the Turing test to say when a machine could be called intelligent 
A computer could be said to think if a human talking with it could not tell it was a machine 
During World War II Turing worked to break German ciphers secret messages 
Using cryptanalysis he helped to break the codes of the Enigma machine 
After that he solved other German codes 
From 0 to 0 Turing worked on the design of the ACE Automatic Computing Engine at the National Physical Laboratory 
He presented a paper on 0 February 0 That paper was the first detailed design of a stored program computer 
Although it was possible to build ACE there were delays in starting the project 
In late 0 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year 
While he was at Cambridge the Pilot ACE was built without him 
It ran its first program on 0 May 0 
In 0 he admitted having had sex with a man in England 
At that time homosexual acts were illegal 
He had to choose between going to jail and taking hormones to lower his sex drive 
He decided to take the hormones 
After his punishment he became impotent 
In May 0 a private member s bill was put before the House of Lords to grant Turing a statutory pardon 
In July 0 the government supported it A royal pardon was granted on 0 December 0 
In 0 after suffering for two years Turing died from cyanide poisoning 
The cyanide came from either an apple which was poisoned with cyanide or from water that had cyanide in it The reason for the confusion is that the police never tested the apple for cyanide 
The treatment forced on him is now believed to be very wrong 
It is against medical ethics and international laws of human rights 
In August 0 a petition asking the British Government to apologise to Turing for punishing him for being a homosexual was started 
The petition received thousands of signatures 
Prime Minister Gordon Brown acknowledged the petition 
He called Turing s treatment appalling

Farming is growing crops or keeping animals by people for food and raw materials 
Farming is a part of agriculture 
Agriculture started at least 0 years ago but no one knows for sure how old it is 
The development of farming gave rise to the Neolithic Revolution whereby people gave up nomadic hunting and settled in what became cities 
Agriculture and domestication probably started in the Fertile Crescent the Nile Valley The Levant and Mesopotamia 
The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of Iraq Syria Turkey Jordan Lebanon Israel and Egypt 
Wheat and barley are some of the first crops people grew 
People probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops but still gathered many foods from the wild 
People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change 
Farming can feed many more people than hunter gatherers can feed on the same amount of land 
Agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals but also growing other things like flowers and nursery plants manure or dung animal hides skins or furs leather animals fungi fibers cotton wool hemp and flax biofuels and drugs biopharmaceuticals marijuana opium 
Many people live by doing what is called subsistence agriculture on a small farm 
Only the farmer s family lives on the farm 
Subsistence agriculture is growing only enough food to feed the farmer his family and his animals 
Extra food or animals are sold for money or other things the farmer cannot grow 
The yield is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land and the yield is often low 
This is because subsistence farmers are generally less educated and they have less money to buy equipment 
When yields are low forests are sometimes cut to provide new land to grow more food 
This is good in the short term but can be bad for the country and the surrounding environment over many years 
In rich countries farms are often much larger 
The yield on farms has got bigger in the last one hundred years because farmers are able to grow better varieties of plants use more fertilizer use more water and more easily control weeds and pests 
Many farms also use machines which cut down on the number of people needed to farm the land 
There are fewer farmers in rich countries but the farmers are able to grow more 
This kind of intensive agriculture comes with its own set of problems 
Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers pesticides chemicals that kill bugs and herbicides chemicals that kill weeds 
These chemicals can pollute the soil or the water 
They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals causing outbreaks of these pests 
The soil can be damaged by erosion blowing or washing away salt buildup or loss of structure 
Irrigation adding water from rivers can pollute water and lower the water table 
These problems have all got solutions and modern young farmers usually have a good technical education 
Farmers select plants with better yield taste and nutritional value 
They also choose plants that are more resistant to disease more tolerant to drought and easier to harvest 
Centuries of careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants 
The crops produce better yield with other techniques use of fertilizers chemical pest control irrigation 
Some companies have been searching for new plants in poor countries and genetically modify these plants to improve them 
They then try to patent the seeds and sell them back to the poor countries 
New plants were created with genetic engineering 
One example of genetic engineering is modifying a plant to resist an herbicide 
It is important for there to be enough food for everyone 
The food must also be safe and good 
They say it is sometimes not safe because it contains some chemicals 
Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment 
For this reason there are several types of agriculture 
Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries 
Intensive agriculture is mostly done in wealthier countries 
It uses pesticides machinery chemical fertilizers 
Organic farming is using only natural products 
Integrated farming is using local resources and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process 
Agricultural policy focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production 
At the policy level common goals of agriculture include 
There are some serious problems that face people trying to grow food today 
The major crops produced in the world in 0 are maize corn wheat rice and cotton

Arithmetic is a name for working with numbers 
It is a part of mathematics 
The four basic arithmetic operations are addition subtraction multiplication and division 
Harder arithmetic includes working with signed numbers fractions and decimals and taking powers and roots 
Most people learn arithmetic in primary school but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned 
Many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic 
A few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include carpenters plumbers auto mechanics accountants architects doctors and nurses 
Arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics science and engineering 
A calculator can be used to do arithmetic 
Computers can do it more quickly which is one reason Global Positioning System receivers have a small computer inside 
Addition is the mathematical way of putting things together 
In arithmetic addition is finding the total of two or more numbers 
The name for the sign is plus 
Another name for the total is the sum 
For example there are objects in two groups 
The objects are small circles o 
One group has five of these objects 
The other group has 0 of these objects 
To find the total number of objects in both groups the objects can be counted 
Another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to add the numbers in each group 
Another method is to add the numbers of objects in group A and group B since they are already counted 
There are rules for adding numbers that people learn 
There are also rules for adding numbers that are built into machines binary adder 
In another counting example Sally and Bill have 0 children 
Sally and Bill get 0 more children 
Sally and Bill have added three children to their two children and now have five children 
The animation above demonstrates the addition of seven hundred and eighty six and four hundred and sixty seven the problems digits have been separated into units tens and hundreds place value 
First the units 0 and 0 are added together to make 0 so 0 ten and 0 units the 0 is written below and the 0 ten is carried to the tens column 
Next in the tens column the 0 and 0 are added together to make 0 tens so 0 hundred and 0 tens the 0 is written below and the 0 hundred is carried to the hundreds column 
Finally in the hundreds column 0 and 0 are added together to make 0 hundreds so 0 thousand and 0 hundreds the 0 is written below and the 0 thousand is carried to the thousand column 
Giving the answer one thousand two hundred and fifty three 
Tom wants to know the distance between his house and Sally s house 
Bob s house is 0 meters east of Tom s house 
Sally s house is 0 meters east of Bob s house 
The distance from Tom s house to Sally s house can be found by adding the distances already measured 
The distance from Tom s house to Bob s house added to the distance from Bob s house to Sally s house is the same as the distance from Tom s house to Sally s house 
That is three hundred 0 meters plus 0 meters 
Addition can also mean to make bigger 
Australia is a country in the Southern hemisphere between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean 
Its official name is the Commonwealth of Australia 
Australia is the sixth biggest country in the world by landmass and is part of the Oceanic and Australasian regions 
The Australian emblem is a flower called the Golden Wattle 
0 million people live in Australia and about 0 of them live on the east coast 
About 0 live in and around the mainland state capitals of Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Perth and Adelaide 
Australia s capital city is Canberra 
Australia is known for its mining and for its production of wool 
Australia is the world s largest producer of bauxite 
Australia New Zealand New Guinea and other islands on the Australian tectonic plate are together called Australasia 
They form one of the world s great ecozones 
When other Pacific islands are included the term is Oceania 
Australia s landmass of 0 square kilometers is on the Indo Australian plate 
The continent of Australia including the island of Tasmania was separated from the other continents of the world many millions of years ago 
Because of this many animals and plants live in Australia that do not live anywhere else 
These include animals like the kangaroo the koala the emu the kookaburra and the platypus 
People first arrived in Australia more than 0 years ago 
These native Australians are called the Australian Aborigines 
For the history of Australia see History of Australia 
Most of the Australian colonies having been settled from Britain became mostly independent democratic states in the 0s and all six combined as a federation on 0 January 0 The first Prime Minister of Australia was Edmund Barton in 0 Australia is a member of the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Nations 
It is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy with Elizabeth II as Queen of Australia and Head of State and a Governor General who is chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out all the duties of the Queen in Australia 
Australia has six states two major mainland territories and other minor territories 
The states are New South Wales Queensland South Australia Tasmania Victoria and Western Australia 
The two major mainland territories are the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory ACT 
In 0 according to world bank Australia had just over 0 million people 
Most Australians live in cities along the coast such as Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Perth Darwin Hobart and Adelaide 
The largest inland city is Canberra which is also the nation s capital 
Australia is a very big country but much of the land is very dry and the middle of the continent is mostly desert 
Only the areas around the east west and south coast have enough rain and a suitable climate not too hot for many farms and cities 
The Australian Aboriginal people arrived in Australia more than 0 years ago 
Until the arrival of British settlers in 0 the Aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land 
They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways 
An example of Aboriginal land management was the Cumberland Plain where Sydney is now 
Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees 
This meant that a lot of grass grew back but not many big trees 
Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains but not in forests 
The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people 
Sometimes Aborigines would name a person after an animal and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population 
Aboriginal people did not usually build houses except huts of grass leaves and bark 
They did not usually build walls or fences and there were no horses cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens 
The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish traps made from stones piled up in the river and the remains of a few stone huts in Victoria and Tasmania 
The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth 
In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked stone spearheads but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood 
Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making 
The boomerang was used in some areas for sport and for hunting 
The Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them 
They believed that they had grown from the land so it was like their mother and they belonged to the land 
In the 0s Dutch merchants traded with the islands of Batavia now Indonesia to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia 
The Dutch Governor van Diemen sent Abel Tasman on a voyage of discovery and he found Tasmania which he named Van Diemen s Land 
Its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it 
The British Government were sure that there must be a very large land in the south that had not been explored 
They sent Captain James Cook to the Pacific Ocean 
His ship HMS Endeavour carried the famous scientists Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Solander who were going to Tahiti where they would watch the planet Venus pass in front of the Sun 
Captain Cook s secret mission was to find Terra Australis the Land of the South 
The voyage of discovery was very successful because they found New Zealand and sailed right around it Then they sailed westward 
At last a boy William Hicks who was up the mast spotted land on the horizon 
Captain Cook named that bit of land Point Hicks 
They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw New South Wales 
At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food 
Joseph Banks and Dr Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were 
They collected hundreds of plants to take back to England 
Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life 
He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit 
But there were no houses and no fences 
In most parts of the world people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land 
But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way 
They belonged to the land like a baby belongs to its mother 
Captain Cook went home to England and told the Government that no one owned the land 
This would later cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people 
In the 0s in England laws were tough many people were poor and gaols jails were full 
A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread 
Many people were hanged for small crimes 
But usually they were just thrown in gaol 
Often they were sent away to the British Colonies in America 
But in the 0s the colonies in America became the United States 
They were free from British rule and would not take England s convicts any more 
By the 0s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships 
The Government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there 
In 0 the First Fleet of eleven ships set sail from Portsmouth carrying convicts sailors marines a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years 
Their leader was Captain Arthur Phillip 
They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered named Botany Bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists 
Captain Phillip found that Botany Bay was flat and windy 
There was not much fresh water 
He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbour which he said was the finest harbour in the world 
There were many small bays on the harbour so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on 
On the 0th January 0 the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of King George III of England and the new settlement was called Sydney 
For the first few years of the settlement things were very difficult 
No one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony 
There was only one man who was a farmer 
There was no one among the convicts who was a builder a brickmaker or a blacksmith 
No one knew how to fix the tools when they broke 
All the plants were different so no one knew which ones could be eaten 
There was a grave danger that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation 
Somehow the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor Arthur Phillip and another hut for the supply of food grew into a small town with streets a bridge over the stream a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships 
By the 0s there was a fine brick house for the Governor 
There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today 
Settlements had spread out from Sydney firstly to Norfolk Island and to Van Diemen s Land Tasmania and also up the coast to Newcastle where coal was discovered and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd 
Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney and by 0 farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England 
While the settlement was growing in New South Wales it was also growing in Tasmania 
The climate in Tasmania was more like that in England and farmers found it easy to grow crops there 
Because Australia is such a very large land it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people 
In the early days of the colony a great number of explorers went out searching for good land to settle on 
When the settlers looked west from Sydney they saw a range of mountains which they called the Blue Mountains 
They were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no one could find their way through them 
In 0 Gregory Blaxland William Lawson and a 0 year old called William Charles Wentworth crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming 
A road was built and the Governor Lachlan Macquarie founded the town of Bathurst on the other side 0 miles from Sydney 
Some people like Captain Charles Sturt were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it Many of the explorers did not prepare very well or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year 
Some died like Burke and Wills 
The second time he was never seen again 
Major Thomas Mitchell was one of the most successful explorers 
He mapped the country as he went and his maps remained in use for more than 0 years 
He travelled all the way to what is now western Victoria and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there 
The Henty brothers had come from Tasmania had built themselves a house had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine 
The goldrushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 0 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry 
By 0 the goldrushes had made some poor people very rich 
The transportation of convicts to Australia ended in the 0s and 0s and more changes came 
The people in Australia wanted to run their own country and not be told what to do from London 
The first governments in the colonies were run by Governors chosen by London 
Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy 
William Wentworth started the Australian Patriotic Association Australia s first political party in 0 to demand democratic government 
In 0 the city councils started and some people could vote 
New South Wales Legislative Council had its first elections in 0 again with some limits on who could vote 
In 0 limited self government was given by London to New South Wales Victoria South Australia and Tasmania 
In 0 the right to vote was given to all men over 0 in South Australia 
Women were given the vote in the Parliament of South Australia in 0 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections 
Australians had started parliamentary democracries all across the continent 
But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament 
Until 0 Australia was not a nation it was six separate colonies governed by Britain 
They voted to join together to form one new country called the Commonwealth of Australia in 0 Australia was still part of the British Empire and at first wanted only British or Europeans to come to Australia 
But soon it had its own money and its own Army and Navy 
In Australia at this time the trade unions were very strong and they started a political party the Australian Labor Party 
Australia passed many laws to help the workers 
In 0 the First World War started in Europe 
Australia joined in on the side of Britain against Germany Austria Hungary and Turkey 
Australian soldiers were sent to Gallipoli in Turkey 
They fought bravely but were beaten by the Turks 
Today Australia remembers this battle every year on ANZAC Day 
They also fought on the Western Front 
More than 0 Australians were killed 
Australia had a really hard time in the Great Depression of the 0s and joined Britain in a war against Nazi Germany when Hitler invaded Poland in 0 But in 0 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in the Fall of Singapore by Japan 
Then Japan started attacking Australia and people worried about invasion 
But with help from the United States Navy the Japanese were stopped 
After the war Australia became a close friend of the United States 
When the war ended Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work 
So the government said it would take in people from Europe who had lost their homes in the war 
It did things like build the Snowy Mountains Scheme 
Over the next 0 years millions of people came to Australia 
They came especially from Italy and Greece other countries in Europe 
Later they also came from countries like Turkey and Lebanon 
An important new party the Liberal Party of Australia was made by Robert Menzies in 0 and it won lots of elections from 0 until in 0 then Gough Whitlam won for the Labor Party 
Whitlam made changes but he made the Senate unhappy and the Governor General sacked him and forced an election in 0 Then Malcolm Fraser won a few elections for the Liberal Party 
In the 0s many people began coming to Australia from China Vietnam Malaysia and other countries in Asia 
In the 0s and 0s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world helped by mining and wool 
Australia started trading more with America then Japan

Today Australia is a rich peaceful and democratic country 
Around 0 of Australians could not get a job in 0 A lot of land in Australia like Uluru has been returned to Aboriginal people but lots of Aborigines are still poorer than everybody else 
Every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as immigrants to live in Australia 
These people may come because they want to do business or to live in a democracy to join their family or because they are refugees 
Australia took 0 million immigrants in the 0 years after World War Two including around 0 refugees

Australia is made up of six states and three mainland territories 
Each state and territory has its own Parliament and makes its own local laws 
The Parliament of Australia sits in Canberra and makes laws for the whole country also known as the Commonwealth or Federation 
The Federal government is led by the Prime Minister of Australia who is the member of Parliament chosen as leader 
The current Prime Minister is Tony Abbott 
The leader of Australia is the Prime Minister although the Governor General represents the Queen of Australia who is also the Queen of Great Britain as head of state 
The Governor General currently Her Excellency Ms Quentin Bryce is chosen by the Prime Minister 
Australia was colonised by people from Britain but today people from all over the world live there 
English is the main spoken language and Christianity is the main religion though all religions are accepted and not everybody has a religion 
Australia is multicultural which means that all its people are helped to keep their different languages religions and ways of life while also learning English and joining in with other Australians

Just 0 years ago Australia had only one big Art festival 
Now Australia has hundreds of smaller community based festivals and national and regional festivals that focus on specific art forms 
Australia is home to many animals that can be found nowhere else on Earth which include the koala the kangaroo the wombat the numbat the emu among many others 
American English or United States English is the dialect of English language spoken in the United States 
It is different in some ways from other variations of English such as British English 
Historically many types of American English can be found in old local dialects of England 
Many people today know about American English even if they live in a country where another form of English is spoken 
This is partly because people hear and read American English via the media for example CNN television and the Internet where the most common form of English is American English 
Because people all over the world use American English as well as other versions of English the English language can add new words 
English has been changing for centuries adding new words to its vocabulary 
For example the English language spoken in India which has more than one billion people will add more American English words to go along with its British English base and many other words adopted into English usage in India from any of the 0 Indian languages 
Sometimes people will learn American English as it is spoken in America 
For example in telephone call centers in India and other places people often learn American English in order to sound more like their customers who call India from America 
These people often continue to use American English in everyday life 
Many word definitions are different in American English 
Most changes in a language start with small things 
For instance Italian Spanish and French all came from Latin 
There are many words that sound the same between American English and British English but are spelled differently 
Words of French origin that end in re in British English metre centre end in er in American English 
In these cases Canadian usage is to keep the British and French spelling 
Many of these differences can be traced to the works of Anglophobe Noah Webster who produced the American dictionary following the American War of Independence 
Some more differences in American English 
There are also some words in American English that are a bit different from British English e g 
Aquaculture is the farming of fish shrimp and algae 
Aquaculture supplies fish such as catfish salmon and trout 
Aquaculture was developed a long time ago in China and aquaculture supplies over 0 of all the seafood harvested 
However aquaculture is quite a new activity in Canada as it only began in 0 It is in simpler terms the farming of seafood 
An abbreviation is a shorter way to write a word or phrase 
People use abbreviations for words that they write a lot 
The English language occasionally uses the apostrophe mark to show that a word is written in a shorter way but some abbreviations do not use this mark More often they use periods especially the ones that come from the Latin language 
Common Latin abbreviations include i e est that is e g gratia for example and et al alia and others 
Some new abbreviations have been created by scientists by workers in companies and governments and by people using the Internet 
People often think words are abbreviations when in fact they are acronyms 
Here are examples of common acronyms The word radar is an acronym for Radio Detection and Ranging 
The name of the large computer company IBM comes from the words International Business Machines 
The name of the part of the United States government that sends rockets into outer space is NASA from the words National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
When people using the Internet think that something is very funny they sometimes write LOL to mean Laughing Out Loud 
People sometimes write ASAP for As Soon As Possible 
In many mythologies and religions an angel is a good spirit 
The word angel comes from the Greek word angelos which means messenger 
Angels appear frequently in the Old Testament the New Testament Qur an and Aqdas 
Angels are powerful smart spirits that obey God s commands and praise him with singing and they have male masculine gender but without any sex 
They sometimes appear to humans in human form They can deliver messages to people in person or in dreams 
Angels that are named in the Bible are Michael called a chief prince Gabriel known for telling Mary that she would be the mother of Jesus and Raphael in the Apocryphal Book of Tobit 
The Ethiopian Book of Enoch also lists four Archangels which watch over the four quadrants of heaven Michael Raphael Gabriel and Uriel 
Lucifer is also known as an angel in the Bible 
0 Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God every precious stone was thy covering the sardius topaz and the diamond the beryl the onyx and the jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepaired in thee in the day that thou wast created 
0 Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and I have set thee so thou wast upon the holy mountain of God thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire 
It describes the sound of their wings like the roar of rushing waters 
Ezekiel 0 Ezekiel 0 reveals that they have hands like a man under their wings 
Ezekiel 0 KJV reveals that they look like man but are different because they have straight feet and four wings and four faces 
Ezekiel ch 0 and 0 describe the cherubim creatures ascending and descending from the earth with wheels 
Ezekiel 0 describes what the wheels appeared to look like and how they moved around how they moved or flew through the sky quickly but turned not as they went and how the inside workings of the wheels appeared to be a wheel in the midst of a wheel and that the color of the wheels was the color of Amber Stone 
There are four separate wheels in both accounts one for each single cherub which is there 
They are often shown in art as having wings and a halo 
The wings represent their speed and the halo represents their holiness 
The cherubim in art always appear as baby faced angels with very small non useful wings 
The cherubim statue or bronze casting of cherubim in the Temple of Solomon depicted them as two four winged creatures whose wings touched at the peak of the ark that they were making 
The same cherubim creatures were said to be cast in gold on top of the Ark of the Covenant 
Casting metal is one of the oldest forms of artwork and was attempted by Leonardo Da Vinci 
The study of Angels is called Angelology 
Ad hominem is a Latin word for a type of argument 
It is a word often used in rhetoric 
Rhetoric is the science of speaking well and convincing other people of your ideas 
Translated to English ad hominem means against the person 
In other words when someone makes an ad hominem they are attacking the person they are arguing against instead of what they are saying 
The term comes from the Latin word homo which means human 
Hominem is a gender neutral version of the word homo 
In ancient Rome it referred to all free men or in other words all free human beings 
Ad hominem can be a way to use reputation rumors and hearsay to change the minds of other people listening 
When a social network has already excluded or exiled one person or applied a negative label to them this can work more often 
It is most of the time considered to be a weak and poor argument 
In courts and in diplomacy ad hominems are not appreciated 
Ad hominems are not wrong every time 
For example when people think that someone can t be trusted things that they have said previously can be doubted 
What an ad hominem argument looks like 
In logic a proof is something that starts with premises and goes through a few logical arguments to reach a conclusion 
In this example it can be seen that the completely unrelated fact that person A is uneducated and poor is used to prove that abortion should not be illegal 
Native Americans also Aboriginal Americans American Indians Amerindians or Indigenous Peoples of America are the people who were in North America Central America South America and the Caribbean Islands when Europeans arrived 
Christopher Columbus was travelling west so he thought he was going to India 
This is why he called the people Indians 
There are more than three million Native Americans in Canada and the U S combined 
Sometimes these people are called Indians but this is confusing because it is the same word used for people from India 
There are many different tribes of Amerindian people with many different languages 
Many Amerindians died after the Europeans came to the Americas from diseases that came with the Europeans that were new to the Amerindians in wars with the Europeans or because the Europeans made them work as slaves 
Most of the Amerindians were hurt or killed by settlers who took their lands 
The ancestors of American Indians came to the Americas from Asia 
Some of them may have come to America over 0 years ago when Alaska was connected to Siberia by the Bering land bridge 
Some Indian tribes and languages of North America are Cherokee Maya or Yucatec Aztecs Navajo and Sioux 
Some Indian tribes and languages of South America are Aymara Guarani Quechua and Tupi 
The apple is a fleshy fruit from the apple tree 
It is in the species Malus domestica in the rose family Rosaceae 
The apple is one of the most grown tree fruits 
The apple tree came from Central Asia 
Its wild ancestor is still there today 
There are more than 0 kinds of different apple trees 
At least 0 million tons of apples were grown around in the world in 0 All together they cost about 0 billion 
China produced about 0 of the world s apples 
The United States produces more than 0 of the apples around the world 
This makes it the second greatest producer 
Iran is third after which comes Turkey Russia Italy and India 
The apple has a small leaf shedding tree that grows up to 0 to 0 metres 0 to 0 ft tall 
The apple tree has a broad crown with thick twigs 
The leaves are alternately arranged simple ovals 
They are 0 to 0 centimetres long and 0 centimetres 0 in wide 
It has a sharp top with a soft underside 
Blossoms come out in spring at the same time that the leaves begin to bud 
They also have a slightly pink color 
They are five petaled and 0 to 0 centimetres 0 to 0 in in diameter 
It is usually 0 to 0 centimetres 0 to 0 in in diameter 
There are five carpels arranged in a star in the middle of the fruit 
Every carpel has one to three seeds 
The wild ancestors of Malus domestica are Malus sieversii 
They grow wild in the mountains of Central Asia in the south of Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan and Xinjiang China and possibly also Malus sylvestris 
Unlike domesticated apples their leaves become red in autumn 
They are being used recently to develop Malus domestica to grow in colder climates 
The apple tree was possibly the earliest tree to be cultivated 
Its fruits have become better over thousands of years 
It is said that Alexander the Great discovered dwarfed apples in Asia Minor in 0 BCE 
Asia and Europe have used winter apples as an important food for thousands of years 
From when Europeans arrived Argentina and the United States have used apples as food as well 
Apples were brought to North America in the 0s 
The first apple orchard on the North American continent was said to be near Boston in 0 In the 0s costly fruit industries where the apple was a very important species began developing 
In Norse mythology the goddess Iðunn gives apples to the gods in Prose Edda written in the 0th century by Snorri Sturluson that makes them young forever 
English scholar H R Ellis Davidson suggests that apples were related to religious practices in Germanic paganism 
It was from there she claims that Norse paganism developed 
She points out that buckets of apples were discovered in the place of burial for the Oseberg ship in Norway 
She also remarks that fruit and nuts Iðunn having been described as changing into a nut in Skáldskaparmál have been discovered in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England 
They have also been discovered somewhere else on the continent of Europe 
She suggests that this may have had a symbolic meaning 
Nuts are still a symbol of fertility in Southwest England 
Sometimes apples are eaten after they are cooked 
Apples can also be made into drinks 
Apple juice and apple cider are apple drinks 
The flesh of the fruit is firm with a taste anywhere from sour to sweet 
Apples used for cooking are sour and need to be cooked with sugar while other apples are sweet and do not need cooking 
There are some seeds at the core that can be removed with a tool that removes the core or by carefully using a knife 
The scientific name of the apple tree genus in the Latin language is Malus 
Most apples that people grow are of the Malus domestica species 
Most apples are good to eat raw not cooked and are also used in many kinds of baked foods such as apple pie 
Apples are cooked until they are soft to make apple sauce 
Apples are also made into the drinks apple juice and cider 
Usually cider contains a little alcohol about as much as beer 
The regions of Brittany in France and Cornwall in England are known for their apple ciders 
If one wants to grow a certain type of apple it is not possible to do this by planting a seed from the wanted type 
The seed will have DNA from the apple that the seeds came from but it will also have DNA from the apple flower that pollinated the seeds which may well be a different type 
This means that the tree which would grow from planting would be a mixture of two 
In order to grow a certain type of apple a small twig or scion is cut from the tree that grows the type of apple desired and then added on to a specially grown stump called a rootstock 
The tree that grows will only create apples of the type needed 
There are more than 0 known cultivars of apples 
Different cultivars are available for temperate and subtropical climates 
One large collection of over 0 apple cultivars is at the National Fruit Collection in England 
Most of these cultivars are grown for eating fresh dessert apples 
However some are grown simply for cooking or making cider 
Cider apples are usually too tart to eat immediately 
However they give cider a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot 
Most popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp 
Colorful skin easy shipping disease resistance Red Delicious apple shape and popular flavor are also needed 
Modern apples are usually sweeter than older cultivars 
This is because popular tastes in apples have become different 
Most North Americans and Europeans enjoy sweet apples 
Extremely sweet apples with hardly any acid taste are popular in Asia and India 
In the United Kingdom there are about 0 different types of apples 
The most common apple type grown in England is the Bramley seedling which is a popular cooking apple 
Apple orchards are not as common as they were in the early 0s when apples were rarely brought in from other countries 
Organizations such as Common Ground teach people about the importance of rare and local varieties of fruit 
Apple Day is celebrated each October 0 in many countries 
Many apples are grown in temperate parts of the United States and Canada 
In many areas where apple growing is important people have huge celebrations 
There are lots of different varieties of apples including 
Apples are in the group Maloideae 
It is a subfamily of the family Rosaceae 
They are in the same subfamily as pears 
Its family is the family of rose like plants and roses are in the family 
An Abrahamic religion is a religion whose people think Abraham was an important person 
The best known Abrahamic religions are Judaism Christianity Islam and the Bahá í Faith 
Abrahamic religions are Monotheistic meaning that they believe in just one God 
They also all believe that people should pray to and worship this God often 
Algebra is a part of mathematics often called math in the United States and maths in the United Kingdom It uses variables to represent a value that is not yet known 
When an equals sign is used this is called an equation 
A very simple equation using a variable is 0 x In this example x 0 or it could also be said x is five 
This is called solving for x 
Besides equations there are inequalities less than and greater than 
A special type of equation is called the function 
This is often used in making graphs 
Algebra can be used to solve real problems because the rules of algebra work in real life and numbers can be used to represent the values of real things 
Physics engineering and computer programming are areas that use algebra all the time 
It is also useful to know in surveying construction and business especially accounting 
People who do algebra need to know the rules of numbers and mathematic operations used on numbers starting with adding subtracting multiplying and dividing 
More advanced operations involve exponents starting with squares and square roots 
Many of these rules can also be used on the variables and this is where it starts to get interesting 
Algebra was first used to solve equations and inequalities 
Two examples are linear equations the equation of a line y mx b and quadratic equations which has variables that are squared power of two a number that is multiplied by itself for example 0 x x 
How to factor polynomials is needed for quadratic equations 
Early forms of algebra were developed by the Babylonians and the Greeks 
However the word algebra is a Latin form of the Arabic word Al Jabr casting and comes from a mathematics book Al Maqala fi Hisab al Jabr wa al Muqabilah Essay on the Computation of Casting and Equation written in the 0th century by a famous Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Mūsā al Khwārizmī who was a Muslim born in Khwarizm in Uzbekistan 
He flourished under Al Ma moun in Baghdad Iraq through 0 AD and died around 0 AD 
The book was brought into Europe and translated into Latin in the 0th century 
The book was then given the name Algebra 
The ending of the mathematician s name al Khwarizmi was changed into a word easier to say in Latin and became the English word algorithm 
Here is a simple example of an algebra problem 
These are the steps you can use to solve the problem 
With practice algebra can be used when faced with a problem that is too hard to solve any other way 
Problems such as building a freeway designing a cell phone or finding the cure for a disease all require algebra 
As in most parts of mathematics adding z to y or y plus z is written as y z 
Subtracting z from y or y minus z is written as y z 
Dividing y by z or y over z formula 0 is written as y z or y z 
y z is more commonly used 
In algebra multiplying y by z or y times z can be written in 0 ways y z y z y z or just yz 
The multiplication symbol is usually not used because it looks too much like the letter x which is often used as a variable 
Also when multiplying a larger expression parentheses can be used y z 0 
When we multiply a number and a letter in algebra we write the number in front of the letter 0 y 0y 
When the number is 0 then the 0 is not written because 0 times any number is that number 0 y y and so it is not needed 
An important part of algebra is the study of functions since functions often appear in equations that we are trying to solve 
A function is like a box you can put a number or numbers into and get a certain number out 
When using functions graphs can be powerful tools in helping us to study the solutions to equations 
A graph is a picture that shows all the values of the variables that make the equation or inequality true 
Usually this is easy to make when there are only one or two variables 
The graph is often a line and if the line does not bend or go straight up and down it can be described by the basic formula y mx b The variable b is the y intercept of the graph where the line crosses the vertical axis and m is the slope or steepness of the line 
This formula applies to the coordinates of a graph where each point on the line is written x y 
In some math problems like the equation for a line there can be more than one variable x and y in this case 
To find points on the line one variable is changed 
The variable that is changed is called the independent variable 
Then the math is done to make a number 
The number that is made is called the dependent variable 
Most of the time the independent variable is written as x and the dependent variable is written as y for example in y 0x 0 This is often put on a graph using an x axis going left and right and a y axis going up and down 
It can also be written in function form f x 0x 0 So in this example we could put in 0 for x and get y 0 Put in 0 for x would get y 0 
And 0 for x would get y 0 
So there would be a line going thru the points 0 and 0 as seen in the graph to the right 
If x has a power of 0 it is a straight line 
If it is squared or some other power it will be curved 
If it uses an inequality or then usually part of the graph is shaded either above or below the line 
In algebra there are a few rules that can be used for further understanding of equations 
These are called the rules of algebra 
While these rules may seem senseless or obvious it is wise to understand that these properties do not hold throughout all branches of mathematics 
Therefore it will be useful to know how these axiomatic rules are declared before taking them for granted 
Before going on to the rules reflect on two definitions that will be given 
Commutative means that a function has the same result if the numbers are swapped around 
In other words the order of the terms in an equation do not matter 
When the operator of two terms is an addition the commutative property of addition is applicable 
In algebraic terms this gives formula 0 
Note that this does not apply for subtraction 
When the operator of two terms is an multiplication the commutative property of multiplication is applicable 
In algebraic terms this gives formula 0 
Note that this does not apply for division 
i e formula 0 when formula 0 
Associative refers to the grouping of numbers 
The associative property of addition implies that when adding three or more terms it doesn t matter how these terms are grouped 
Note that this does not hold for subtraction e g formula 0 see the distributive property 
The associative property of multiplication implies that when multiplying three or more terms it doesn t matter how these terms are grouped 
Note that this does not hold for division e g formula 0 
The distributive property states that the multiplication of a number by another term can be distributed 
Do not confuse this with the associative properties 
Identity refers to the property of a number that it is equal to itself 
In other words there exists an operation of two numbers so that it equals the variable of the sum 
The additive identity property states that the sum of any number and 0 is that number formula 0 
This also holds for subtraction formula 0 
The multiplicative identity property states that the product of any number and 0 is that number formula 0 
This also holds for division formula 0 
The additive inverse property is somewhat like the opposite of the additive identity property 
When an operation is the sum of a number and its opposite and it equals 0 that operation is a valid algebraic operation 
Algebraically it states the following formula 0 
The multiplicative inverse property entails that when an operation is the product of a number and its reciprocal and it equals 0 that operation is a valid algebraic operation 
Algebraically it states the following formula 0 
In addition to elementary algebra or basic algebra there are advanced forms of algebra taught in colleges and universities such as abstract algebra linear algebra and universal algebra 
This includes how to use a matrix to solve many linear equations at once 
Abstract algebra is the study of things that are found in equations 
These things are known as algebraic structures 
Understanding the properties of more complex algebraic structures can help us solve more complex equations 
Many math problems are about physics and engineering 
In many of these physics problems time is a variable 
Using the basic ideas in algebra can help reduce a math problem to its simplest form making it easier to solve difficult problems 
Energy is e force is f mass is m acceleration is a and speed of light is sometimes c 
This is used in some famous equations like f ma and e mc 0 although more complex math beyond algebra was needed to come up with that last equation 
An atom is the basic unit that makes up all matter 
There are many different types of atoms each with its own name mass and size 
These different types of atoms are called chemical elements 
The chemical elements are organized on the periodic table 
Examples of elements are hydrogen and gold Atoms are very small but the exact size changes depending on the element 
Atoms range from 0 to 0 nanometers in width 
One nanometer is around 0 times smaller than the width of a human hair 
This makes atoms impossible to see without special tools 
Equations must be used to see the way they work and how they interact with other atoms 
Atoms come together to make molecules or particles for example two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom combine to make a water molecule a form of a chemical reaction 
Atoms themselves are made up of three kinds of smaller particles called protons which are positively charged neutrons which have no charge and electrons which are negatively charged 
The protons and neutrons are in the middle of the atom 
They are surrounded by a cloud of electrons which are attracted to the nucleus positive charge 
This attraction is called electromagnetic force 
Protons and neutrons are made up of even smaller particles called quarks 
Electrons are elementary or fundamental particles they cannot be split into smaller parts 
The number of protons neutrons and electrons an atom has determines what element it is 
Hydrogen for example has one proton no neutrons and one electron the element sulfur has 0 protons 0 neutrons and 0 electrons 
Atoms move faster when in gas form as they are free to move than liquid and solid matter 
In solid materials the atoms are tightly next to each other so they vibrate but are not able to move there is no room as atoms in liquids do 
The word atom comes from the Greek ἀτόμος indivisible from ἀ not and τόμος a cut 
The first historical mention of the word atom came from works by the Greek philosopher Democritus around 0 BC 
Atomic theory stayed as a mostly philosophical subject with not much actual scientific investigation or study until the development of chemistry in the 0s 
In 0 French chemist Antoine Lavoisier defined the term element for the first time 
He said that an element was any basic substance that could not be broken down into other substances by the methods of chemistry 
Any substance that could be broken down was a compound 
In 0 English philosopher John Dalton suggested that elements were tiny solid spheres made of atoms 
Dalton believed that all atoms of the same element have the same mass 
He said that compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine 
According to Dalton in a compound atoms of different elements always combine the same way 
In 0 British scientist Robert Brown looked at pollen grains in water and used Dalton s atomic theory to describe patterns in the way they moved 
In 0 Albert Einstein used mathematics to prove that the seemingly random movements were down to the reactions of atoms and by doing so he conclusively proved the existence of the atom 
In 0 scientist Dmitri Mendeleev published the first version of the periodic table 
The periodic table groups atoms by their atomic number how many protons they have 
This is usually the same as the number of electrons 
Elements in the same column or period usually have similar properties 
For example helium neon argon krypton and xenon are all in the same column and have very similar properties 
All these elements are gases that have no colour and no smell 
Together they are known as the noble gases 
The physicist J J Thomson was the first man to discover electrons 
This happened while he was working with cathode rays in 0 He realized they had a negative charge unlike protons positive and neutrons no charge 
Thomson created the plum pudding model which stated that an atom was like plum pudding the dried fruit electrons were stuck in a mass of pudding protons 
In 0 a scientist named Ernest Rutherford used the Geiger Marsden experiment to prove that most of an atom is in a very small space called the atomic nucleus 
Rutherford took a photo plate and surrounded it with gold foil and then shot alpha particles at it Many of the particles went through the gold foil which proved that atoms are mostly empty space 
Electrons are so small they make up only 0 of an atom s mass 
In 0 Niels Bohr introduced the Bohr model 
This model showed that electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed circular orbits 
This was more accurate than the Rutherford model 
However it was still not completely right 
Improvements to the Bohr model have been made since it was first introduced 
In 0 chemist Frederick Soddy found that some elements in the periodic table had more than one kind of atom 
For example any atom with 0 protons should be a helium atom 
Usually a helium nucleus also contains two neutrons 
However some helium atoms have only one neutron 
This means they are still helium as the element is defined by the number of protons but they are not normal helium either 
Soddy called an atom like this with a different number of neutrons an isotope 
To get the name of the isotope we look at how many protons and neutrons it has in its nucleus and add this to the name of the element 
So a helium atom with two protons and one neutron is called helium 0 and a carbon atom with six protons and six neutrons is called carbon 0 
However when he developed his theory Soddy could not be certain neutrons actually existed 
To prove they were real physicist James Chadwick and a team of others created the mass spectrometer 
The mass spectrometer actually measures the mass and weight of individual atoms 
By doing this Chadwick proved that to account for all the weight of the atom neutrons must exist 
In 0 German chemist Otto Hahn became the first person to create nuclear fission in a laboratory 
He discovered this by chance when he was shooting neutrons at a uranium atom hoping to create a new isotope 
However he noticed that instead of a new isotope the uranium simply changed into a barium atom 
This was the world s first recorded nuclear fission reaction 
This discovery eventually led to the creation of the atomic bomb 
Further into the 0th century physicists went deeper into the mysteries of the atom 
Using particle accelerators they discovered that protons and neutrons were actually made of other particles called quarks 
The most accurate model so far comes from the Schrödinger equation 
Schrödinger realized that the electrons exist in a cloud around the nucleus called the electron cloud 
In the electron cloud it is impossible to know exactly where electrons are 
The Schrödinger equation is used to find out where an electron is likely to be 
This area is called the electron s orbital 
The complex atom is made up of three main particles the proton the neutron and the electron 
The isotope of Hydrogen Hydrogen 0 has no neutrons and a positive hydrogen ion has no electrons 
These are the only known exceptions all other atoms have at least one proton neutron and electron each 
Electrons are by far the smallest of the three their mass and size is too small to be measured using current technology 
Protons and neutrons are of similar size to each other Protons are positively charged and neutrons have no charge 
Most atoms have a neutral charge because the number of protons positive and electrons negative are the same the charges balance out to zero 
However in ions different number of electrons this is not always the case and they can have a positive or a negative charge 
Protons and Neutrons are made out of quarks of two types up quarks and down quarks 
A proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark and a neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark 
The nucleus is in the middle of an atom 
It is made up of protons and neutrons 
Usually in nature two things with the same charge repel or shoot away from each other 
So for a long time it was a mystery to scientists how the positively charged protons in the nucleus stayed together 
They solved this by finding a particle called a Gluon 
Its name comes from the word glue as Gluons act like atomic glue sticking the protons together using the strong nuclear force 
It is this force which also holds the quarks together that make up the protons and neutrons 
The number of neutrons in relation to protons defines whether the nucleus is stable or goes through radioactive decay 
When there are too many neutrons or protons the atom tries to make the numbers the same by getting rid of the extra particles 
It does this by emitting radiation in the form of alpha beta or gamma decay 
Nuclei can change through other means too 
Nuclear fission is when the Nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei releasing a lot of stored energy 
This release energy is what makes nuclear fission useful for making bombs and electricity in the form of nuclear power 
The other way nuclei can change is through nuclear fusion when two nuclei join together or fuse to make a heavier nucleus 
This process requires extreme amounts of energy in order to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the protons as they have the same charge 
Such high energies are most common in stars like our Sun which fuses hydrogen for fuel 
Electrons orbit or go around the nucleus 
They are called the atom s electron cloud 
They are attracted towards the nucleus because of the electromagnetic force 
Electrons have a negative charge and the nucleus always has a positive charge so they attract each other 
Around the nucleus some electrons are further out than others 
In most atoms the first shell has two electrons and all after that have eight 
Exceptions are rare but they do happen and are difficult to predict 
The further away the electron is from the nucleus the weaker the pull of the nucleus on it This is why bigger atoms with more electrons react more easily with other atoms 
The electromagnetism of the nucleus is not enough to hold onto their electrons and they lose them to the strong attraction of smaller atoms 
Some elements and many isotopes have what is called an unstable nucleus 
This means the nucleus is either too big to hold itself together or has too many protons electrons or neutrons 
When this happens the nucleus has to get rid of the excess mass or particles 
An atom that does this can be called radioactive 
Unstable atoms continue to be radioactive until they lose enough mass particles that they become stable 
All atoms above atomic number 0 protons are radioactive 
There are three main types of radioactive decay alpha beta and gamma 
Every radioactive element or isotope has something called a half life 
This is how long it takes half of any sample of atoms of that type to decay until they become a different stable isotope or element 
Large atoms or isotopes with a big difference between the number of protons and neutrons will therefore have a long half life 
Astronomy is the study of the universe and everything in it This includes stars planets and galaxies as well as other things 
The word astronomy comes from the Greek words astron which means star and nomos which means law 
A person who studies astronomy is called an astronomer 
Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences 
Ancient people used the positions of the stars to navigate and to find when was the best time to plant crops 
Astronomy is very similar to astrophysics 
Since the 0th century there have been two main types of astronomy observational and theoretical astronomy 
Observational astronomy uses telescopes and cameras to observe or look at stars galaxies and other astronomical objects 
Theoretical astronomy uses maths and computer models to predict what should happen 
The two often work together the theoretical predicts what should happen and the observational shows whether the prediction works 
Astronomy is not the same as astrology the belief that the patterns the stars and the planets may affect human lives 
Early astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars 
They used maps of the constellations and stars for religious reasons and also to work out the time of year 
Early civilisations such as the Maya people and the Ancient Egyptians built simple observatories and drew maps of the stars positions 
They also began to think about the place of Earth in the universe 
For a long time people thought Earth was the center of the universe and that the planets the stars and the sun went around it This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe 
Ancient Greeks tried to explain the motions of the sun and stars by taking measurements 
A mathematician named Eratosthenes was the first who measured the size of the Earth and proved that the Earth is a sphere 
A theory by another mathematician named Aristarchus was that the sun is in the center and the Earth is moving around it This is known as the Heliocentric model 
Only a small group of people thought it was right 
The rest continued to believe in the geocentric model 
Most of the names of constellations and stars that we have come from Greeks of that time 
Arabic astronomers made many advancements during the Middle Ages including improved star maps and ways to estimate the size of the Earth 
During the renaissance a priest named Nicolaus Copernicus thought from looking at the way the planets moved that the Earth was not the center of everything 
Based on previous works he said that the Earth was a planet and all the planets moved around the sun bringing the heliocentric model back to the light 
A physicist called Galileo Galilei built his own telescope and used it to look more closely at the stars and planets for the first time 
Their ideas were also improved by Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton who came up with the theory of gravity 
At this time the Catholic Church decided that Galileo was wrong 
The Pope gave the order to lock Galileo up in his house and they did not let him write any more books until he died 
After Galileo people made better telescopes and used them to see farther objects such as the planets Uranus and Neptune 
They also saw how stars were similar to our Sun but in a range of colours and sizes 
They also saw thousands of other faraway objects such as galaxies and nebulae 
The 0th century saw important changes in astronomy 
In 0 Karl Jansky discovered radio emission from outside the Earth when trying to isolate a source of noise in radio communications marking the birth of radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the electromagnetic spectrum to observe the sky 
Those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy allowing more discoveries to be made 
The opening of this new window on the Universe saw the discovery of entirely new things for example pulsars which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space 
The waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that it implied an artificial source 
The period after World War 0 saw more observatories where large and accurate telescopes are built and operated at good observing sites normally by governments 
For example Bernard Lovell began radio astronomy at Jodrell Bank using leftover military radar equipment 
By 0 the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world 
Similarly the end of the 0s saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at Mauna Kea in Hawaii a good site for visible and infra red telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies 
Mauna Kea would eventually come to host very large and very accurate telescopes like the Keck Observatory with its 0 meter mirror 
The next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of rocketry 
This allowed telescopes to be placed in space on satellites 
Satellite based telescopes opened up the Universe to human eyes 
Turbulence in the Earth s atmosphere blurs images taken by ground based telescopes an effect known as seeing 
It is this effect that makes stars twinkle in the sky 
As a result the pictures taken by satellite telescopes in visible light for example by the Hubble Space Telescope are much clearer than Earth based telescopes even though Earth based telescopes are very large 
Space telescopes gave access for the first time in history to the entire electromagnetic spectrum including rays that had been blocked by the atmosphere 
The X rays gamma rays ultraviolet light and parts of the infra red spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing telescopes were launched 
As with other parts of the spectrum new discoveries were made 
From 0s satellites were launched to be replaced with more accurate and better satellites causing the sky to be mapped in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum 
Discoveries broadly come in two types bodies and phenomena 
Bodies are things in the Universe whether it is a planet like our Earth or a galaxy like our Milky Way 
Phenomena are events and happenings in the Universe 
For convenience this section has been divided by where these astronomical bodies may be found those found around stars are solar bodies those inside galaxies are galactic bodies and everything else larger are cosmic bodies 
Burst events are those where there is a sudden change in the heavens that disappears quickly 
These are called bursts because they are normally associated with large explosions producing a burst of energy 
Periodic events are those that happen regularly in a repetitive way 
The name periodic comes from period which is the length of time required for a wave to complete one cycle 
Noise phenomena tend to relate to things that happened a long time ago 
The signal from these events bounce around the Universe until it seems to come from everywhere and varies little in intensity 
In this way it resembles noise the background signal that pervades every instrument used for astronomy 
The most common example of noise is static seen on analogue televisions 
The principal astronomical example is Cosmic background radiation 
There are way astronomers can get better pictures of the heavens 
Light from a distant source reaches a sensor and gets measured normally by a human eye or a camera 
For very dim sources there may not be enough light particles coming from the source for it to be seen 
One technique that astronomers have for making it visible is using integration which is like longer exposures in photography 
Astronomical sources do not move much only the rotation and movement of the Earth causes them to move across the heavens 
As light particles reach the camera over time they hit the same place making it brighter and more visible then the background until it can be seen 
Telescopes at most observatories and satellite instruments can normally track a source as it moves across the heavens making the star appear still to the telescope and allowing longer exposures 
Also images can be taken on different nights so exposures span hours days or even months 
In the digital era digitised pictures of the sky can be added together by computer which overlays the images after correcting for movement 
With radio telescopes smaller telescopes can be combined together to create a big one which works like one as big as the distance between the two smaller telescopes 
Adaptive optics means changing the shape of the mirror or lens while looking at something to see it better 
Data analysis is the process of getting more information out of an astronomical observation than by simply looking at it The observation is first stored as data 
This data will then have various techniques used to analysis analyse it 
Fourier analysis in mathematics can show if an observation over a length of time is changing periodically changes like a wave 
If so it can extract the frequencies and the type of wave pattern and find many things including new planets 
A good example of a fields comes from pulsars which pulse regularly in radio waves 
These turned out to be similar to some but not all of a type of bright source in X rays called a Low mass X ray binary 
It turned out that all pulsars and some LMXBs are neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in which the neutron star was found 
Those LMXBs that were not neutron stars turned out to be black holes 
This section attempts to provide an overview of the important fields of astronomy their period of importance and the terms used to describe them 
It should be noted that astronomy in the Modern Era has been divided mainly by electromagnetic spectrum although there is some evidence this is changing 
Solar astronomy is the study of the Sun 
The Sun is the closest star to Earth at around 0 million 0 miles away 
It is the easiest to observe in detail 
Observing the Sun can help us understand how other stars work and are formed 
Changes in the Sun can affect the weather and climate on Earth 
A stream of charged particles called the Solar wind is constantly sent off from the Sun 
The Solar Wind hitting the Earth s magnetic field causes the northern lights 
Studying the Sun helped people understand how nuclear fusion works 
Planetary Astronomy is the study of planets moons dwarf planets comets and asteroids as well as other small objects that orbit stars 
The planets of our own Solar System have been studied in depth by many visiting spacecraft such as Cassini Huygens Saturn and the Voyager 0 and 0 
Galactic Astronomy is the study of distant galaxies 
Studying distant galaxies is the best way of learning about our own galaxy as the gases and stars in our own galaxy make it difficult to observe 
Galactic Astronomers attempt to understand the structure of galaxies and how they are formed through the use of different types of telescopes and computer simulations 
Hydrodynamics is used in astronomy for mathematically modelling how gases behave 
Strong magnetic fields found around many bodies can drastically change how these gases behave affecting things from star formation to the flows of gases around compact stars 
This makes MHD an important and useful tool in astronomy 
Gravitational wave astronomy is the study of the Universe in the gravitational wave spectrum 
So far all astronomy that has been done has used the electromagnetic spectrum 
Gravitational Waves are ripples in spacetime emitted by very dense objects changing shape which include white dwarves neutron stars and black holes 
Because no one has been able to detect gravitational waves directly the impact of Gravitational Wave Astronomy has been very limited 
Architecture is the science of the design of structures or buildings such as houses places of worship office buildings 
Architecture is also the profession of an architect 
A person must study at an institution of higher education to become an architect 
Architecture can be about small designs such as a garage or large designs such as a whole city 
Architecture often overlaps with civil engineering and architects and civil engineers often work together 
In the past people built huts and wood houses to protect themselves from the weather 
For safety they were often close together 
Great civilizations like the Ancient Egyptians built large temples and structures like the Great Pyramids of Giza 
The Ancient Greeks and Romans made what we now call Classical Architecture 
The Romans working over 0 years ago copied the arch from the Etruscans who copied it from the Mesopotamians 
The stone columns which still hold up so many important buildings like the Parthenon in Athens were simply copied from the first wooden posts 
Classical Architecture was very formal it always obeyed laws 
It used symmetry which really means balance and it used proportion which means keeping shapes in certain ways 
The Golden Mean was a rule or law which said to put it very simply if you are making a room or any other thing it will work best if you always make the long side 0 times longer than the short side 
There are many laws in Classical Architecture like how high the middle of an arched bridge needs to be which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be 
These laws were learned from thousands of years of experience and they are as true today as they were 0 years ago 
In some parts of the world like India the architecture is famous for carving the stone on temples and palaces 
Different architectural styles were made in China Japan Southeast Asia Africa Mexico and Central and South America 
Later people in Western Europe in the Middle Ages made Romanesque architecture then Gothic architecture 
Gothic buildings have tall pointed windows and arches 
Castles were also built at this time 
In Eastern Europe churches usually had domes 
People added their own ideas and decoration to the Classical Architecture of the past The Renaissance brought a return to classical ideas 
In the late 0th century with the Industrial Revolution people began to invent machines to make things quickly and cheaply 
Many factories and mills were built during or after this revolution 
Decades later in the Victorian era architects like George Fowler Jones and Decimus Burton still followed the Gothic style to build new churches
