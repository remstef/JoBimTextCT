Aamras is the pulp of mangos that is usually eaten in India 
An aggregate fruit is a fruit that develops from a single flower but the flower has more than one ovary and the ovaries join together as the fruit grows 
A fruit that grows from just one flower that contains just one ovary is not an aggregate fruit but a simple fruit 
Not all flowers with multiple ovaries grow into aggregate fruit the ovaries of some flowers do not become tightly joined together to make a larger fruit 
Aggregate fruits may also be accessory fruits 
In accessory fruits parts of the flower that are not the ovary become juicy and form part of the fruit 
Aggregate fruits include 
An airén is a type of white grape used to make wine 
The aubergine also called eggplant is a vegetable 
It is in the Nightshade family of plants 
It is related to the potato and tomato 
Originally it comes from India and Sri Lanka 
The fruit of the aubergine plant is commonly used as a vegetable 
The Açaí palm Assai palm is a type of palm tree 
There are seven different types of Açaí palms 
The tree grows in Central and South America 
It has a black purple fruit about the size of a grape called a euterpe 
The seed inside is very big 
The fruit grows in bunches of 0 to 0 fruits 
The palms are mainly used for two things First salads called palmitos heart of palm can be made from the leaves for this the tree needs to be cut down 
Secondly the fruits can be made into a fruit juice that is said to be very healthy 
Banana is the common name for a type of herb and also the name for the herbaceous plants that grow this herb 
These plants belong to the genus Musa 
They are native to the tropical region of Southeast Asia 
There are about 0 different species of banana 
It is thought that bananas were grown for food for the first time in Papua New Guinea 
Today they are cultivated in tropical regions around the world 
Most banana plants are grown for their herbs but some are grown as ornamental plants or for their fibres 
In parts of Africa beer has been made by fermenting the juice of certain cultivars known as beer bananas 
The ash of banana can be used to make soap 
In Asia bananas are often planted to provide shade to plants that like shade for example coffee cocoa nutmeg or black pepper 
Because of this banana plants can often be found in plantations of other crops 
Some kinds or cultivars of banana have a firmer starchier fruit 
These kinds are called plantains 
Plantains are mostly used for cooking or fibre 
The sweet soft bananas that are used for desserts are called dessert bananas 
The banana plant is the largest herbaceous flowering plant 
Banana plants are often mistaken for trees 
Bananas have a false stem called pseudostem which is made by the lower part of the leaves 
This pseudostem can grow to be two to eight metres tall 
Each pseudostem grows from a corm 
A pseudostem is able to produce a single bunch of bananas 
After fruiting the pseudostem dies and is replaced 
When most bananas are ripe they turn yellow or sometimes red Banana leaves grow in a spiral and may grow long and wide 
They are easily torn by the wind which results in a familiar frayed look 
The banana fruits grow from a banana heart in hanging clusters also called a bunch or banana stem 
The fruits grow in rows called tiers or hands 
There can be as many as twenty fruits to a hand and as many as twenty tiers in a bunch 
A bunch usually weighs between 0 and 0 kilograms 0 to 0 pounds 
A single fruit weighs about 0 grams 0 ounces on average about three quarters of this is water 
Each banana or finger has a protective outer layer called peel or skin 
There is a fleshy part inside that readily spilts into three segments 
It is the only known tri segmented fruit in the world 
Both the skin and inner part can be eaten 
Western cultures generally eat the inside raw and throw away the skin while some Asian cultures eat both the skin and inside cooked 
Each fruit has many strings that run between the skin and the inner part Bananas have a lot of vitamin B0 vitamin C and potassium 
Growing and trading bananas 
Bananas are grown in at least 0 countries 
In popular culture and commerce banana usually refers to soft sweet dessert bananas 
The bananas from a group of cultivars with firmer starchier fruit are called plantains 
Bananas may also be cut and dried and eaten as a type of chip 
Dried bananas are also ground into banana flour 
The banana species growing in the wild have fruits with many hard large seeds 
Almost all bananas grown to be eaten have seedless fruits 
Bananas are classified either as dessert bananas or as green cooking bananas 
Almost all export bananas are of the dessert types 
Only about ten to fifteen percent of all production is for export 
Dessert bananas change their color and usually turn yellow when they are ripe plantains and bananas generally used for cooking stay green 
Certain bananas have other colors when ripe 
The countries that produce the most bananas include India Brazil China Ecuador and the Philippines 
The top five countries that exported bananas were Ecuador Costa Rica the Philippines Colombia and Guatemala 
The United States the European Union and Japan buy the most bananas 
Bananas are among the most valuable agricultural export products They provided about sixty percent of export earnings of Saint Lucia and about twelve percent of the Gross Domestic Product of the country between 0 and 0 Some people are allergic to bananas 
There are two basic forms of these allergies 
The first is known as oral allergy syndrome 
Within an hour of eating a banana swelling starts inside the mouth or throat 
This allergy is related to allergies caused by pollen like that of the birch tree 
The other is similar to latex allergies 
It causes urticaria and potentially serious upper gastrointestinal symptoms 
Different uses of bananas 
The fibre gained from the banana plant has been used to make textiles for a long time 
In Japan bananas have been grown to be used for clothing and in the house since at least the 0th century 
In the Japanese system the leaves and shoots are cut from the plant periodically to make sure they are soft 
The harvested shoots must first be boiled in lye to prepare the fibres for the making of the yarn 
These banana shoots produce fibres of varying degrees of softness 
They can be used for yarns and textiles of different qualties and for specific uses 
For example the outermost fibres of the shoots are the coarsest they are good for tablecloths 
The softest innermost fibres are desirable for kimono and kamishimo 
This traditional Japanese banana cloth making process has many steps all performed by hand 
Another system is used in Nepal 
There the trunk of the banana plant is harvested instead 
Small pieces of this trunk are then softened 
The fibres are extracted mechanically bleached and dried 
They are then sent to the Kathmandu Valley where high end rugs are produced 
These rugs have a texture and general qualities similar to that of silk 
These banana fibre rugs are woven by traditional Nepalese hand knotted methods 
Banana fibre is also used to make banana paper 
There are two different kinds of banana paper Paper made from the bark and paper made from the fibre and from unused fruits 
Bing is a cultivar farmed type of the wild or sweet cherry Prunus avium that started in the Pacific Northwest in Milwaukie Oregon United States 
The Bing remains a major cultivar in Oregon Washington and British Columbia 
It is the most produced variety of sweet cherry in the United States 
The cultivar was created as a crossbred graft from the Republican cherry in 0 by Oregon horticulturist Seth Lewelling and his Manchurian Chinese foreman Ah Bing for whom the cultivar is named 
Ah Bing was reportedly born in China and immigrated to the U S in about 0 He worked as a foreman in the Lewelling family fruit orchards in Milwaukie for about 0 years supervising other workers and caring for trees 
He went back to China in 0 for a visit 
Due to the restrictions of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 0 he never returned to the United States 
Some say Ah Bing developed the cultivar others that it was developed by Lewelling and named in Bing s honour due to his long service as orchard foreman 
Horticultural production 
Bing cherries are used almost exclusively for fresh market 
Bings are large dark and firm cherries that ship well but will crack open if exposed to rain near harvest 
A wet climate is required for the harvest of the bing cherry 
Bing cherries are high in anti oxidants 
A study by the United States Department of Agriculture has shown that fresh Bing cherries may help sufferers of arthritis and gout 
However the U S Food and Drug Administration warns that these are yet unproven claims 
Blackcurrant Ribes nigrum is a small bitter tasting fruit 
It can be found in central and northern Europe and northern Asia 
Blackcurrant has a lot of vitamin C in it Blackcurrant gets its name from its dark color 
It is also used to make jelly ice cream and cordial 
Blackcurrant is a popular flavor in the United Kingdom 
Blackcurrants are also used in salads and in baking similar to raisins 
A category is a group of people or things that are the same in some way 
Cherry is a fruit that grows on a tree or a bush 
It belongs to the genus Prunus 
It is usually red with a seed in the middle 
It tastes slightly sour and is often used to flavour cakes and ice cream or is baked in a pie or cobbler

The Coconut palm is a type of palm tree 
It is a part of the Family Arecaceae palm family 
It is a large palm growing to 0 m tall 
It has leaves that are 0 m long 
The term coconut refers to the fruit of the coconut palm 
The coconut tree is a monocot 
There are many coconut palms in the coastal belt of India and Bangladesh 
People of this area use coconut milk in cooking 
Women use coconut oil as hair oil for hair 
The coconut s shell is relatively hard but can be broken 
Because its shell is hard it can be used as an ingredient to make craftworks 
Coconut milk is also used in many drinks 
Coconut oil is often in food and soaps 
People in Sri Lanka use coconut flowers for wedding celebrations 
In the Maldives it is the National tree 
A coconut is a large nut 
Coconuts grow in tropical countries 
The flesh of a coconut is white and can be eaten raw or used in cooking 
It is used in many of the foods we eat for flavour 
It is native to tropical areas 
Coconuts can float on water and if they fall in the ocean they can float to another island and germinate there 
It has often been noted that coconuts can travel 0 days or 0 miles by sea and still be able to germinate 
The term compound fruit is not used in botany but is sometimes used when it is not clear which of several fruit types a fruit belongs to 
A compound fruit is composed of two or more similar parts 
A compound fruit may be Grapes grow in clusters but are not compound fruits 
Each grape is grown from one ovary in one flower and they are not attached to one another 
The cucumber Cucumis sativus is a widely grown plant in the family Cucurbitaceae 
This family also includes squash 
A cucumber looks similar to a zucchini British English courgette 
Cucumbers are fruits and are often called vegetables 
They can be cooked eaten raw or pickled 
A currant is a type of fruit 
They are like grapes 
There are two different species 
One famous type of currant is the gooseberry 
The Date Palm is a tree 
It has been cultivated for a very long time because of its edible fruit 
This fruit is called date 
The tree is between 0m and 0m high 
It has long leaves that look like feathers 
Such leaves are called pinnate 
The leaves can grow to 0 metres in length 
The leaves have visible spines 
There are about 0 leaflets 
Each leaflet can be up to 0 cm in length and 0 cm in breadth 
The full span of the crown of the tree is 0 to 0 metres 
The tree has one or more trunks that all come from a single system of roots 
World production of dates was approximately 0 Mio tonnes in 0 FAO statistics 
The major producers are The First International Date Conference was held in Tripoli in 0 In that conference it was decided to develop a special program under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to promote the commercial use of substandard or physically defective dates 
Pitaya fruit pitahaya fruit commonly known as the dragon fruit is a fruit from Central America and South America 
It is a favorite to many particularly people of Asian origin 
It has a light sweet taste an intense shape and color and outstanding flowers 
In addition to being tasty and refreshing this contains a lot of water and other vital minerals with varied nutritional ingredients 
Easter Eggplant is a hybrid is a plant of Nightshade family related with aubergine S melongena Stem and leafstalks are green or very faintly tinged with purple and bear a few white spines 
Leaves are wavy at the edges 
Flowers are lilac it is recognized by its oblong fruit also grown as an ornamental plant for covering walls or trellises 
The Feijoa or Pineapple Guava or Guavasteen Feijoa sellowiana is an evergreen shrub or small tree 0 m in height 
It comes from the highlands of southern Brazil parts of Colombia Uruguay Paraguay and northern Argentina 
They are also grown throughout Azerbaijan Georgia Russia Sochi and New Zealand 
Description of fruit and plant 
The fruit matures in autumn and is green and about the size and shape of an egg 
It has a sweet aromatic flavour 
The flesh is juicy 
The fruit drops when ripe but can be picked from the tree before to prevent bruising 
Feijoa fruit have a distinctive smell 
The chemical methyl benzoate smells strongly of feijoas and the aroma of the fruit is caused mostly by this and other closely related chemicals 
It is a warm temperate to subtropical plant that will also grow in the tropics but requires some winter chilling to fruit 
In the northern hemisphere it has been cultivated as far north as western Scotland but does not fruit every year as winter temperatures below about 0 C will kill the flower buds 
A lot of feijoa are grown in New Zealand where the fruit is a popular garden tree and the fruit is commonly available in season 
The fruit is usually eaten by cutting it in half then scooping out the pulp with a spoon 
It is popular in New Zealand to Stew them in a pot with sugar and serve hot with vanilla icecream in the wintertime 
The fruits have a juicy sweet seed pulp and slightly gritty flesh nearer the skin 
The flavour is aromatic and sweet 
If the utensils needed to eat it this way are not available the feijoa can be torn or bitten in half and the contents squeezed out and consumed 
Fruit maturity is not always apparent from the outside as the fruits remain green until they are overmature or rotting 
When the fruits are immature the seed pulp is white and opaque becoming clear and jelly like when ripe 
Fruits are at their optimum maturity when the seed pulp has turned into a clear jelly with no hint of browning 
Once the seed pulp and surrounding flesh start to brown the fruit is over mature and should not be eaten 
Fig genus Ficus is a soft sweet fruit 
Its skin is very thin and has many small seeds inside of it There are more than 0 species of Ficus the fig tree 
The fruits can be eaten when ripe and when dried 
Figs grow in warm climates 
Sometimes figs are made into jam 
Figs are also in a popular snack 
Figs are pollinated by fig wasps 
The fig fruit is called a synconium 
Many figs are grown for their fruit though only Ficus carica the Common Fig is cultivated to any extent for human consumption 
The fig is a false fruit or multiple fruit in which the flowers and seeds grow together to form a single mass 
Depending on the species each fruit can contain up to several hundred to several thousand seeds 
A fig fruit is derived from a specially adapted type of inflorescence an arrangement of multiple flowers 
In this case it is a turned inwards nearly closed receptacle with many small flowers arranged on the inner surface 
Thus the actual flowers of the fig are unseen unless the fig is cut open 
It is a fruit without a visible flower 
Contents of the fruit 
The fig fruits important as both food and traditional medicine contain laxative substances flavonoids sugars vitamins A and C acids and enzymes 
However figs are skin allergens and the sap is a serious eye irritant 
Some parthenocarpic virgin fruit cultivars of Common Figs do not require pollination at all and will produce a crop of seedless edible figs without caprifigs or fig wasps 
Pollination and fig wasps 
The syconium often has a bulbous shape with a small opening the ostiole at the outward end used by pollinators 
The flowers are pollinated by very small wasps which crawl through the opening in search of a suitable place to lay eggs 
Without this fig trees cannot reproduce by seed 
In turn the flowers provide a safe haven and nourishment for the next generation of wasps 
This has led to a co evolutionary relationship 
Fig plants can be monoecious hermaphrodite or gynodioecious hermaphrodite and female 
Nearly half of fig species are gynodioecious and have plants with inflorescences syconium with long styled pistillate flowers or have plants with staminate flowers mixed with short styled pistillate flowers 
The long flower styles tend to prevent wasps from laying their eggs within the ovules while the short styled flowers are accessible for egg laying 
The Common Fig Ficus carica is a gynodioecious plant which means its fruits are either hermaphrodite and inedible figs or caprifigs 
In traditional culture in the Mediterranean region they were considered food for goats Capra aegagrus caprifig means goat fig 
In the female fig trees the male flower parts fail to develop they produce the edible figs 
Fig wasps grow in caprifigs but not in the female syconiums 
The female flower is too long for the wasp to successfully lay her eggs in them 
Nonetheless the wasp pollinates the flower with pollen from the caprifig it grew up in 
When the wasp dies it is broken down by enzymes inside the fig This means you do not eat the wasp because it has been dissolved 
The wasp does not transmit any diseases harmful to humans 
There is typically only one species of wasp capable of fertilizing the flowers of each species of fig 
For example in Hawaii some 0 species of figs have been introduced but only four of the wasps that fertilize them have been introduced so only four species of figs produce viable seeds there 
This is an example of mutualism in which each organism fig plant and fig wasp benefit each other in this case reproductively 
The intimate association between fig species and their wasp pollinators and the one to one plant pollinator ratio are a clear example of co evolution 
Recent genetic and molecular dating analyses have shown a close correspondence in the evolution and speciation of these two clades figs and wasps 
In botany a fruit is a plant structure that contains the plant s seeds 
The word fruit is used only if it comes from the part of the flower which was an ovary 
It is an extra layer round the seeds which may or may not be fleshy 
However even in botany there is no general agreement on how fruits should be classified 
Many do have extra layers from other parts of the flower 
The fleshy part of a fruit is called the mesocarp 
It is between the fruit s skin exocarp and the seeds 
The white part of an apple for example is the fleshy part of the apple 
Usually when we eat a fruit we eat the fleshy part If the entire fruit is fleshy except for maybe a thin skin we call the fruit a berry 
A berry might contain one seed or many 
Grapes avocados and blueberries are berries 
They all have a thin skin but most of the fruit is fleshy 
Strawberries however are actually not berries because the seeds are on the outside on a real berry the seed or seeds must be inside 
A pepo pronounced pee po is a modified berry 
Its skin is hard and thick and is usually called a rind 
Pumpkins and watermelons for instance are pepos 
A hesperidium pronounced hes per id ee uhm is another modified berry 
It has a leathery skin that is not as hard as the skin of a pepo 
All citrus fruit like oranges and lemon are hesperidiums 
A pome pohm is a fruit that has a core surrounded by fleshy tissue that we can eat 
The core is usually not eaten 
Berries are different the seeds are inside the fleshy part not separated from it by a core 
Apples and pears are pomes 
Drupes are also called stone fruit 
A drupe is a fleshy fruit with a hard stone around the seed 
We usually call this stone the pit of the fruit 
Peaches and olives are drupes 
Actually the almond fruit is a drupe too though we eat the seed that is inside the pit of the almond fruit 
Since fruits are produced from fertilised ovaries in flowers only flowering plants produce fruits 
Fruits are an evolutionary invention which help seeds get dispersed by animals 
The botanical term includes many that are not fruits in the common sense of the term such as the vegetables squash pumpkins cucumbers tomato peas beans corn eggplant and sweet pepper and some spices such as allspice and chillies 
An accessory fruit or false fruit pseudocarp is a fruit in which some of the flesh is derived not from the ovary but from some adjacent tissue 
A fig is a type of accessory fruit called a syconium 
Pomes such as apples and pears are also accessory fruits the core is the true fruit 
Non botanical fruits 
Strictly speaking these are not botanical fruits These are fruits which you can buy in shops and which are also acceptable as botanical fruits Many fruits come from trees or bushes 
For plants fruits are a means of dispersal usually by animals 
When the fruit breaks apart the seeds can go into the ground and begin to grow 
Most fruits we eat contain a lot of water and natural sugars and many are high in Vitamin C They have a large amount of dietary fibre 
Fruits are usually low in protein and fat content but avocados and some nuts are exceptions to this 
Not only humans but our closest living relatives primates are keen fruit eaters 
So are many other groups of herbivorous mammals and many birds 
Seedlessness is an important feature of some fruits of commerce 
Commercial bananas pineapple and watermelons are examples of seedless fruits 
Some citrus fruits especially oranges satsumas mandarin oranges and grapefruit are valued for their seedlessness 
Seedless bananas and grapes are triploids and seedlessness results from the abortion of the embryonic plant which is produced by fertilisation 
The method requires normal pollination and fertilisation 
Fruit salad is a dish with of different kinds of fruit 
Fruit salad can sometimes be served in a liquid like juices or a syrup 
Most of the time it is served as an appetizer or as a dessert 
A fruit salad is sometimes known as a fruit cocktail or fruit cup 
A fruit tree is a tree that produces edible fruits to hold its seeds 
However although every tree produces fruit not all fruit is edible for humans 
Nut trees bear such fruits as almonds walnuts brazil nuts 
Goji goji berry or wolfberry is the fruit of Lycium barbarum and Lycium chinense 
These are two very closely related species of boxthorn in the family Solanaceae which also includes the potato tomato eggplant deadly nightshade chili pepper and tobacco 
The two species are native to Asia 
Grapes are the fruit of a woody grape vine 
Grapes can be eaten raw or used for making wine juice and jelly jam 
Grapes come in different colours red purple white and green are some examples 
Today grapes can be seedless by using machines to pit the fruit 
Wild grapevines are often considered a nuisance weed as they cover other plants with their usually rather aggressive growth 
Raisins are the dried fruit of the grapevine and the name actually comes from the French word for grape 
Since the early 0st century in the United States and other countries and the global functional food industry there has been a fast growing recognition of red grapes for their popularity nutrient content and antioxidant qualities 
This has given them commercial status as a superfruit 
The leaves of the grapevine itself are considered edible eatable 
They are used to make dolmades 
Grapevines are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species 
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO almost 0 square kilometres of the world is used to grow grapes 
About 0 of grapes are used for wine 
0 are used as fresh fruit and 0 are used as dried fruit 
A part of grape production goes to making grape juice to be used as a sweetener for fruits canned with no added sugar and 0 natural 
The area dedicated to vineyards is increasing by about 0 per year 
The following list of top wine producers shows the areas used to grow grapes for wine making although of course country size is a limiting factor as well as the economic demand for their product 
Comparing diets among western countries researchers have found that although the French usually eat more animal fat than other countries the number of cases of heart disease remains low in France 
Many scientists think this is because the French drink more red wine than other countries 
Something in the grape helps lower the amount of cholesterol in the body 
This helps prevent clogging of the arteries 
Doctors do not recommend drinking a lot of red wine but three or four glasses a week is good and encouraged 
Grapes of all colors offer benefits 
Red wine offers health benefits that are not found in white wine 
This is because many of the good nutrients are found in the skins of the grapes and only red wine is fermented with the skins 
White grapes are derived from the green grape by evolution 
Changes in two genes turn off creation of anthocyanin 
Anthocyanin is what makes red grapes the color green 
Raisins currants and sultanas 
A raisin is any dried grape 
A currant is a dried Zante grape 
The name is a corruption of the French raisin de Corinthe Corinth grape 
A sultana was originally a raisin made from a specific type of grape of Turkish origin 
The word is now used for raisins made from common North American grapes and chemically treated to resemble the traditional sultana 
Note that while raisin is a French loanword the word in French means the fresh fruit 
Grappe Where the English word grape comes from means the bunch as in une grappe de raisin 
Note also that currant has also come to mean to the blackcurrant and redcurrant 
These two berries completely unrelated to grapes 
Guarana or Guaraná or Paullinia cupana syn 
P 
crysan P sorbilis is a shrub or small tree in the Sapindaceae family 
It is native to Venezuela and northern Brazil 
The seed of the Guaraná fruit is a stimulant with thermogenic and diuretic properties 
The guaraná fruit s color ranges from orange to red and contain black seeds which are partly covered by white arils 
The color contrast when the fruit has been split open has been likened to eyeballs this has formed the basis of a myth see below 
Guaraná plays an important role in Tupi and Guaraní Brazilian culture 
The name guaraná is derived from the Tupi Guarani word wara ná 
These tribes believed it was magical a cure for bowel complaints and a way to regain strength 
They also tell the myth of a Divine Child that was killed by a serpent and whose eyes gave birth to this plant 
Guaraná is mainly used as an ingredient in soft drinks and energy drinks 
It is also used as a dietary supplement generally to promote weight loss 
In addition it may be an ingredient in other foods 
In addition to other chemicals the guaraná plant contains caffeine sometimes called guaranine theophylline and theobromine 
Water extracts of the guarana plant are central nervous system stimulants due to the content of these alkaloids 
Energy drink manufacturers typically add synthetic caffeine or caffeine derived from coffee decaffeination though many advertise natural caffeine from the seeds of guaraná 
Brazil produces several brands of soft drink from guaraná extract that contain no added caffeine 
Each differs greatly in flavour some have only a slight guaraná fruit taste 
They are typically fizzy and sweet with a very fruity aftertaste 
Most guaraná drinks are produced in Brazil and consumed locally or in nearby countries such as Paraguay 
Major brands include Guaraná Antarctica Guaraná Schin from Schincariol and Guaraná Brahma from AmBev Kuat and Guaraná Jesus a local Brazilian brand named for the druggist that formulated it Many local producers also create drinks not for export 
Using it to lose weight 
Studies involving guaraná show benefits to cognitive function 
They have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration FDA or any similar government agencies 
In the United States guaraná holds a GRAS status i e generally regarded as safe and must be labeled as not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease 
The Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics published a study in June 0 This study shows an average 0 pound weight loss in a group taking a mixture of yerba mate guaraná and damiana compared to an average 0 pound loss in a placebo group after 0 days 
A university study in Brazil of guaraná extract showed a platelet aggregation decrease of up to 0 of control values and a decrease of platelet thromboxane formation from arachidonic acid of up to 0 of control values 
This study may be significant to stroke and heart attack risk reduction because when excess thromboxane formation occurs an arterial blood clot can develop resulting in a heart attack or ischemic stroke 
A separate 0 study of guaraná s effects on the physical activity of rats showed increased memory retention and physical endurance when compared with a placebo 
Other studies have shown antioxidant antibacterial and fat cell reduction when combined with conjugated linoleic acid properties in guaraná Although side effects of guaraná are rare drugs com recommends When considering the use of herbal supplements consultation with a primary health care professional is advisable 
Additionally consultation with a practitioner trained in the uses of herbal health supplements may be beneficial and coordination of treatment among all health care providers involved may be advantageous 
Drugs com also advises not to mix guaraná with ephedrine 
What guarana is made of 
Guaraná seeds consist of mostly reddish vegetable fiber and resin with a small amount of oil and water 
Guarana contains different amounts of caffeine theobromine theophylline and other alkaloids compared to coffee tea mate or cocoa

Guaranine and caffeine 
The chemical guaranine is identical to caffeine coming from other sources for example coffee tea and mate 
Guaranine theine mateine are all official synonyms for caffeine 
Crataegus Hawthorn is a large genus of shrubs in the family Rosaceae 
They are found in Europe Asia and North America 
The name hawthorn used to be used for the species found only in northern Europe but is now used for the entire genus 
The same name is also used for the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis 
Hawthorn are shrubs and small trees 
They grow to 0 m tall and have small fruit 
The fruit are called haws 
Kiwifruit Actinidia deliciosa is a fruit 
It has an oval shape and is green on the inside with small black seeds that are edible 
The kiwi has furry brown skin that is edible but is usually removed 
The skin is relatively thin 
The kiwi is native to South China 
The fruit was named in 0 after the kiwi a bird and symbol of New Zealand 
Before that its English name was Chinese gooseberry 
The kiwifruit is healthy and contains many vitamins and minerals like vitamin C potassium and fiber 
Kiwis have more vitamin C than an equivalent amount of orange 
There are different types of kiwifruit 
The main types are hayward the most common green kiwifruit chico saanichton 0 and golden kiwifruit 
Golden kiwifruit are sweeter than normal green kiwifruit 
Golden kiwifruit was invented by grafting and cross pollinating different types of kiwifruit 
A legume is a type of dry fruit 
Legumes can be a variety of fruits peas and beans are types of legumes 
What legumes have in common 
Legumes grow from the carpel the female reproductive part of a plant 
The fruit of a legume is found inside a pod that can be split on both sides 
However there are some foods that grow inside pods that are not legumes 
Legumes contain many healthy nutrients such as protein 
They are a good source of protein for vegetarians and vegans people who do not eat meat 
They also contain fibre which promotes a healthy digestive system However they contain some nutrients which humans struggle to digest 
It is recommended that a legume is soaked in a weak acid for about 0 hours before cooking to destroy these nutrients 
Some amino acids such as methionine are not abundant in some legumes but are needed to help the body use protein 
India imports buys from other countries the most legumes 
This may be because a lot of Indians follow the religion of Hinduism which does not approve of people eating meat 
Legumes are a cheap and plentiful source of food in a country where around 0 of the population are in poverty 
The top four producers and exporters selling to other countries of legumes are The USA uses legumes for a variety of reasons and is the highest producer 
It uses soybeans to feed cattle and make vegetable oil 
Peanuts are a popular snack food in the USA and these are also a type of legume 
Fruits on this wiki are defined as the word is used in everyday speech 
It does not include vegetables whatever their origin 
The following are fruits 
List of national fruits This is a list of national fruits arranged alphabetically by country 
Some national fruits are officially designated some are unofficial 
Lucuma fruits are found in Peru and Chile 
Lucuma have been eaten for many centuries 
Anthropologists have found ancient burial sites with lucuma seeds 
Lucuma is used in a variety of culinary drinks and desserts 
Lucuma is the most popular ice cream flavor in Peru 
Multiple fruits are fruits that grow from more than one flower called an inflorescence 
Each flower in the inflorescence produces a fruit and then these join together 
There are also many multiple fruits that become dry later 
In languages other than English the meanings of multiple and aggregate fruit are reversed 
Examples of multiple fruits 
Nectar in botany is a liquid made by the flowers of plants 
It is very sweet because it has a lot of sugar in it Plants make nectar to attract pollinating animals 
It is made in glands called nectaries 
The Nectaries are usually at the bottom of the perianth 
This means the animal trying to get the nectar have to touch the parts of the plant that are used for reproduction 
By doing this the animal getting the nectar helps the plants reproduce 
Some plants make nectar outside the flower 
These plants do it to attract predatory insects 
These insects will eat both the nectar and any plant eating insects found near the plant 
Nectar is economically important because it is where the sugar for honey comes from 
It is also useful in agriculture and horticulture because the adults of many predatory insects as well as hummingbirds eat nectar 
Nectar from fruits can also be drunk by people
